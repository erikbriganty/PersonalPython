# and test grades of 5 students from the data file “grades.txt”.
# Use the split function to separate the names
# and test scores and convert the test scores to numeric values.

# b) Calculate the average of the test scores.

# c) Display the names, test scores and the average on the screen as follows:
# Name Grade
# ---------------------
# Mickey Mouse 90.0
# Jane Doe 50.0
# Minnie Mouse 95.0
# Donald Duck 80.0
# Daffy Duck 70.0
# Average Grade: 77.0

# d) Prompt the user for a new first name, last name and grade.
